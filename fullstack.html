<h1 align=left><strong> What is Full Stack Development? </strong></h1>
<font face="Arial" size=5>

<p> Full Stack Development is developing both the client and server side of a web application.
    The client side is actually building the visual part where the user will see the design and
    layout of the website and have a feel while the server side is building the part where 
    different functionalities will be carried out.</p>

<p> Due to surge in website development to make a presence online, full stack developers are high in
    demand. Essentially webdevelopment comes with a lot of problems, so they might lack skills so
    that they can solve all the problems. For this it is recommended to learn some parts of 
    full stack development at mastery so that one can be high in demand.</p>

<p> Both frontend and backend are great careers. Coping up with front-end is not easy as ever-changing     taste of users and coming up of new technologies and design norms. On the other hand
    backend has a very systematic development rule in industry which makes it easy to adopt. Backend
    is time-consuming to learn and require more analytical and problem solving skills which makes
    it more paid than frontend though.</p>

<p> Depending upon interest and comfort in building one can choose any domain or both the domains.
    Being very good in a particular technology is also a good idea. Learning modern workflow with
    comfort in using Git and Github is very important skill.</p>

<dt> <b><u>Programming Language</u></b>

<dd> 
 <p>Programming Language choice is really important. Programming is actually solving science and
     math problems thorough a language to give it useful shape in real life.</p>

     <p>One thing we can conclude that we need independence to give anything a shape. For this purpose
     C++ is really a very cool language.</p>
 
 <p>Keeping Web Development in mind, learning <b>python</b> and <b>java</b> is useful as they are
    widely used as backend language. But there is no such norm that one must learn this two languages.
    One can learn C++ and Python too. For language it is recommended to learn C++, Python and some
    Java.</p>


 <dt><b><u>Math Knowledge</u></b>

 <dd>
 <p> Some knowledge of aptitude and mathematics is very important in programming. Discrete Math
     know to understand the algorithms and some linear algebra is highly recommended.</p>

 <p> Go through AMC 8, AMC 10 problems and then Discrete Math book by Rosen to stronghold your
     mathematics foundation. </p>

 <dt><b><u>Data Structures and Algorithms</u></b>
  
  <dd>

 <p> One thing that should be kept in mind that <b>Math</b> and <b>Algo</b> are not
     necessary for full stack web-development. It gives you enough computer science knowledge
     to tackle different situations and write efficient code. If you don't get enough of this
     topics, no problem. Geeting a basic hold of them is a plus point only.</p>

 <p> For DS algo it is quite similar like the competetive programming portion. Get hold of a book 
     like Algorithm Design by Eva Tardos, read a particular algorithm and solve some problems 
     related to it. To do algorithms, go through searching, sorting and read data structures like
     linked list, stack , queue and solve around 300 problems. You are done with it.</p>


 <dt><b><u> Others </u></b>

 <dd> 

 <p> Some knowledge about html, css and javascript can really help to pick up the thing fast. Many 
     recommend that before getting into a bootcamp or learning the core web-development technologies
     a good ammount independent study is required.</p>

 <p> Prerequisites are actually the independent study that you should do. Other than that join or 
     learn through tutorials online some web-development and do some personal projects. Even make
     a full stack website on your own. A good number of independent projects, solving a few hundreds
     of algorithmic problems can make you a full stack developer withing ten months.</p>
