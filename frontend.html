<h1 align=left><strong> Brief Introduction </strong></h1>  
<font face="Arial" size=5>

<p> Front-end web development, also known as client-side development is the practice of producing     HTML, CSS and JavaScript for a website or Web Application so that a user can see and interact with     them directly. The challenge associated with front end development is that the tools and     techniques used to create the front end of a website change constantly and so the developer needs     to constantly be aware of how the field is developing.</p>

<p> The objective of designing a site is to ensure that when the users open up the site they see the       information in a format that is easy to read and relevant. This is further complicated by the fact     that users now use a large variety of devices with varying screen sizes and resolutions thus           forcing the designer to take into consideration these aspects when designing the site. They need       to ensure that their site comes up correctly in different browsers (cross-browser), different         operating systems (cross-platform) and different devices (cross-device), which requires careful        planning on the side of the developer.</p>

<h1 align=left><strong> Word of Advice </strong></h1>

<font face="Arial" size=5>

<p> Whatever domain you choose in CS, there are some basic grammer in programming. A lot have been
    discussed about different prerequisites, but this is the most basic thing. You need to know
    how to use you IDE, write efficient code, and know how to test.</p>

<p> Modern IDE's offer various features which makes the life of a programmer really easy helping
    to complete a task in less time. Hence if one knows all the functions of the IDE well then 
    he can code really fast.</p>

<p> Now technology always demands the highest possible efficiency. This is a hard thing to master. 
    The most efficient solutions are highly technical and hard to understand and implement. But these
    have became like regular practice to keep up with the pace users want. This needs understanding
    the baseline of problem most of the functions you programming language offers and engineering
    knowledge. It is adviced to write code using comments, follow the industry practice and learn
    problem solving. This takes time and require really sincere effort and something which you can't
    skip. This also makes programming a hard thing to learn. Put time into it.</p>
